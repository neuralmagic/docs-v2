# Installing DeepSparse

DeepSparse is Neural Magic's inference engine, empowering you to run deep learning models on CPUs with exceptional performance and efficiency.
This guide covers various installation methods, including PyPI, Docker, and installation from the GitHub source code for advanced use cases.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements

- <b>CPU</b>: x86 with AVX2 instructions (Intel Haswell or newer, AMD Zen 2 or newer) or ARM v8.2 or newer.
- <b>RAM</b>: Minimum 1GB (model and configuration dependent)

### Software Requirements

- <b>OS:</b> Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS, RedHat, etc.). MacOS (beta).
- <b>Python:</b> 3.8 - 3.11
- <b>ONNX:</b> Version 1.5.0 - 1.15.0 (opset 11 or higher)

## Community Installation

### PyPI

For the most common use case, install the current release version of DeepSparse using PyPI:

<VersionInjector targetProduct="deepsparse" targetVersion="==VERSION" prepend="==">
    ```bash
    pip install deepsparse==VERSION
    ```
</VersionInjector>

<!--
### Docker

Deploy DeepSparse in a containerized environment using our Docker image:

<VersionInjector targetProduct="deepsparse" prepend="v" currentTag="latest">
    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/neuralmagic/deepsparse:VERSION
    docker run -it ghcr.io/neuralmagic/deepsparse:VERSION
    ```
</VersionInjector>
-->

### GitHub (Advanced)

For development purposes or advanced use cases, install directly from the GitHub repository:

<VersionInjector targetProduct="deepsparse" prepend="v" currentTag="main" ignoreNightly={true} ignoreLastVersion={true}>
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse.git@VERSION
    ```
</VersionInjector>

Or from a locally cloned repository:

<VersionInjector targetProduct="deepsparse" prepend="tags/v" currentTag="main" ignoreNightly={true} ignoreLastVersion={true}>
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse.git
    cd deepsparse
    git checkout VERSION
    pip install -e .[dev]
    ```
</VersionInjector>

## Enterprise Installation

### PyPI

DeepSparse Enterprise provides enhanced features and production-grade support.
See our [Enterprise Guide](/guides/enterprise) for obtaining a license key and more information.

<VersionInjector targetProduct="deepsparse-ent" ignoreNightly={true} targetVersion="==VERSION" prepend="==">
    ```bash
    pip install deepsparse-ent==VERSION
    ```
</VersionInjector>

#### Installing a License
Once you have obtained a license, you will need to initialize it to be able to run DeepSparse Enterprise. You can initialize your license by running:

`deepsparse.license <license_string> or <path/to/license.txt>`

To initialize a license on a machine:

1. Confirm you have deepsparse-ent installed in a fresh virtual environment. Installing deepsparse and deepsparse-ent on the same virtual environment may result in unsupported behaviors.
2. Run `deepsparse.license` with the `<license_string>` or `path/to/license.txt` as an argument:
- `deepsparse.license <samplelicensetring>`
- `deepsparse.license ./license.txt`
3. If successful, `deepsparse.license` will write the license file to `~/.config/neuralmagic/license.txt`. You may overwrite this path by setting the environment variable `NM_CONFIG_DIR` (before and after running the script) with the following command:
`export NM_CONFIG_DIR=path/to/license.txt`
4. Once the license is authenticated, you should see a splash message indicating that you are now running DeepSparse Enterprise.

If you encounter issues initializing your DeepSparse Enterprise License, contact Neural Magic through your dedicated support channel.

#### Validating a License
Once you have initialized your license, you may want to check that it is still valid before running a workload on DeepSparse Enterprise. To confirm your license is still active with DeepSparse Enterprise, run the command:

`deepsparse.validate_license`

`deepsparse.validate_license` can be run with no arguments, which will reference an existing environment variable (if set), or with one argument that is a reference to the license and can be referenced in the `deepsparse.validate_license` command as `path/to/license.txt`.

To validate a license on a machine:

1. If you have successfully run `deepsparse.license`, `deepsparse.validate_license` can be used to validate that the license file is in the correct location:
    - Run the `deepsparse.validate_license` with no arguments. If the referenced license is valid, the DeepSparse Enterprise splash screen should display in your terminal window.
    - If the `NM_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable was set when creating the license, ensure this variable is still set to the same value.

2. If you want to supply the `path/to/license.txt`:
    - Run `deepsparse.validate_license` with `path/to/license.txt` as an argument as: `deepsparse.validate_license --license_path path/to/license.txt`
    - If the referenced license is valid, the DeepSparse Enterprise splash screen should display in your terminal window.

## Specialized Installations
