For each token produced, all of the LLM\'s weights must be read. Since these models are usually several gigabytes in size, this can take a lot of time and causes this portion of the pipeline to be highly memory-bound - meaning most of the time is spent waiting for the weights to be read. As a result, compression is king. If the model weights can be made smaller, then we can simply read less memory. This is where sparsity comes in since many weights are zero and can be efficieintly compressed. Compounded with other techniques like quantization, we can start to get really small models and excellent generation latency.'}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,s.jsx)(t.img,{alt:"Text Generation Decode Performance Sparsity Scaling",src:i(6308).A+"",width:"2094",height:"1476"})}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"text-generation-prefill-performance",children:"Text Generation Prefill Performance"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Prefilling, the process of generating initial context or "priming" the model before actual text generation, is another critical aspect where sparsity plays a vital role. During prefill, the LLM quickly processes a large volume of context data to provide relevant and coherent continuation. Sparse models, due to their reduced number of parameters and effective removal of FLOPs, enable faster processing of this context data, leading to improved prefill performance.
