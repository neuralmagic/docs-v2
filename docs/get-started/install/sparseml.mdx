# Installing SparseML

Welcome to the SparseML installation guide. Here, you'll find instructions for various installation methods including PyPI and advanced options via GitHub.

:::note
The installation commands correspond to the version of SparseML you're viewing in the documentation.
:::

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements

- CPU
  - Intel, AMD, and ARM CPUs are all supported.
- RAM
  - 4GB or more is recommended, but it depends on the flow and model being used.
- GPU
    - NVIDIA GPUs are supported and tested and it is recommended to have a GPU with at least 16GB of memory.
    - AMD GPUs are supported but not actively tested.

### Software Requirements

- OS
  - Linux is supported and is tested across Ubuntu, CentOS, and RedHat distributions.
  - macOS is supported but not actively tested.
  - Windows is not supported at this time. However, Windows users can install SparseML via Docker or a virtual machine.
- Python 3.8-3.11
- PyTorch >= 1.1.0, < 2.2


## Installation

### PyPI

To install the current version of SparseML via PyPI, utilize the following command:

<VersionInjector targetProduct="sparseml" targetVersion="==VERSION" prepend="==">
    ```bash
    pip install sparseml==VERSION
    ```
</VersionInjector>

### GitHub

Advanced users can install from source code by utilizing the following command:

<VersionInjector targetProduct="sparseml" prepend="v" currentTag="main" ignoreNightly={true}>
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml.git@VERSION
    ```
</VersionInjector>

Additionally, the following commands install via GitHub, but from a locally cloned repository:

<VersionInjector targetProduct="sparseml" prepend="tags/v" currentTag="main" ignoreNightly={true}>
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml.git
    cd sparseml
    git checkout VERSION
    pip install -e .
    ```
</VersionInjector>

## Specialized Installations

### Generative AI: HuggingFace

For generative AI, particularly transformer architectures, this extra provides built in support for models like Llama, Mistral, MPT, GPT, and others.
It enables compatibility of HuggingFace's transformers pipelines and models to SparseML allowing SOTA pruning, quantization, and other optimizations.

<VersionInjector targetProduct="sparseml[llm]" targetVersion="==VERSION" prepend="==">
    ```bash
    pip install sparseml[llm]==VERSION
    ```
</VersionInjector>

### Object Detection: YOLOv8

For object detection, this extra provides built in support for YOLOv8 models.
It enables compatibility of YOLOv8 models to SparseML allowing SOTA pruning, quantization, and other optimizations.

<VersionInjector targetProduct="sparseml[yolov8]" targetVersion="==VERSION" prepend="==">
```bash
pip install sparseml[yolov8]==VERSION
```
</VersionInjector>

### Image Classification: TorchVision

For image classification, this extra provides built in support for TorchVision models.
It enables compatibility of TorchVision models to SparseML allowing SOTA pruning, quantization, and other optimizations.

<VersionInjector targetProduct="sparseml[torchvision]" targetVersion="==VERSION" prepend="==">
    ```bash
    pip install sparseml[torchvision]==VERSION
    ```
</VersionInjector>

### Natural Language Processing: HuggingFace

For natural language processing, this extra provides built in support for HuggingFace's transformers models.
It enables compatibility of HuggingFace models to SparseML allowing SOTA pruning, quantization, and other optimizations.

<VersionInjector targetProduct="sparseml[transformers]" targetVersion="==VERSION" prepend="==">
    ```bash
    pip install sparseml[transformers]==VERSION
    ```
</VersionInjector>

### Development

For development purposes, this extra provides built in support for development tools.
