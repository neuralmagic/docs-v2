## Selecting a Model

Begin your journey with Neural Magic by selecting the right model for your application. You have two primary options:

1. SparseZoo: An open-source repository filled with a variety of sparsified models. SparseZoo provides you with readily available models that are optimized for efficient deployment. Choose from a wide range of models that are pre-sparsified and ready to be deployed in your applications.
2. Your Own Models: If you have a custom model developed in PyTorch or ONNX format, you can directly integrate it with Neural Magic’s tools. This flexibility allows you to apply Neural Magic’s optimization and deployment technologies to models specifically tailored to your unique use cases.

## Optimizing a Model

Optimizing your models for better performance and efficiency is crucial. With Neural Magic’s SparseML, this process is streamlined using state-of-the-art (SOTA) research techniques. SparseML provides:

- Advanced Sparsification Techniques: Utilize cutting-edge research in sparsity to optimize your models. This includes techniques like pruning and quantization, which help in reducing model size and improving inference speed.
- Accessible Optimization: SparseML is designed to be user-friendly, enabling anyone to apply these optimization techniques to their models. Whether you are a seasoned ML practitioner or new to the field, SparseML guides you through the process of optimizing your models for better performance.


## Deploying a Model

With Neural Magic’s DeepSparse, you can deploy your selected model with exceptional performance on CPUs. DeepSparse is designed to provide GPU-class performance, solely utilizing CPU resources. This approach brings a significant advantage in terms of accessibility and cost-effectiveness for deploying deep learning models. Here’s what DeepSparse offers:

- Efficient CPU Deployments: Leveraging the power of sparsity, DeepSparse allows you to deploy models on CPUs without compromising on performance, making the most of the available hardware.
- Seamless Integration: DeepSparse is built to be easily integrated into your existing applications, reducing the need for extensive code rewriting and accelerating the deployment process.
