## DeepSparse Pipeline 

The DeepSparse Pipeline provides an easy to use interface for interacting with LLMs. To create a pipeline use the `create` method. 
```python
from deepsparse import Pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline.create(
        task="text_generation",
        model_path="hf:neuralmagic/MiniChat-1.5-3B-pruned50-quant-ds",
    )
generation_config = {"temperature": 0.8, "do_sample": True, "max_new_tokens": 300}
result = pipeline(
    prompt="A character receives a mysterious package containing an object theyâ€™ve never seen before. What is it and how does it change their life?",
    generation_config=generation_config,
)
print(result.generations[0].text)
"""
Determining the potential themes for the story and characters interactions would require additional character development, background information...
"""
```
### Pipeline Knobs
The following Pipeline parameters can be adjusted:
- `max_new_tokens` to dictate the maximum number of new tokens to generate
- `sequence_length` to determine the sequence length of the model 
- `do_sample` whether to sample the output 
- `temperature` to alter the selection process of the next word by adding temperature into the softmax operation
